# DCAM
DC Programming Fundamental Classes: A Matlab modeling and optimization toolbox (based on object oriented programming) for general dc program.

This project is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 11601327) and the Key Construction National “985” Program of China (Grant No: WF220426001).

## Instruction
This toolbox provides three main classes: DC function class (\verb|dcfunc|), DC programming problem class (\verb|dcp|), and DCA class (\verb|dca|). You can use these classes to model and solve a DC programming problem within few lines of codes. 

There are two version of DCAM. The version with postfix `poly` is particularly designed for polynomial optimization using (POLYLAB)[https://github.com/niuyishuai/Polylab] toolbox. The version without postfix is used for general DC programming models.
